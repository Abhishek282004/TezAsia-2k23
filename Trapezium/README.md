# Trapezium Marketplace

Trapezium Marketplace is a decentralized NFT marketplace built on the Tezos blockchain, where users can seamlessly buy, sell, and trade NFTs. Our platform empowers artists, creators, and collectors to showcase their unique creations and engage in trustless transactions.

## Problem Statement

The Tezos blockchain community lacked a dedicated NFT marketplace that provided decentralized ownership and transparent transactions. Trapezium Marketplace fills this void, offering a user-friendly and accessible platform for NFT enthusiasts.

**Challenges Faced:**

- Existing NFT marketplaces were not user-friendly for beginners.
- Users couldn't easily create their own NFTs and have fun while doing so.
- The lack of engagement and activity on other marketplaces made it less enjoyable for creators to sell their NFTs.
